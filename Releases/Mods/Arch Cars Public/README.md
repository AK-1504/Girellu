# Arch Modified Physics
>**Attention drifters! Do not use CSP versions from 1.73 to 1.78**. These versions have a modified slip function, where it is changed from the default sin(angle) to tan(angle). The slip function has been changed back to sin(angle) for versions after 1.78.

## Installation
The install_arch_cars.bat script will automate installing of the car mods inside this folder. If you want to pick which cars to download, then you will have to manually install them.
### Install with .bat script (recommended, installs all cars)
Run the install_arch_cars.bat script and follow instructions within. Any errors mean you are missing a mod or AC DLC content.
### Manual install (individual, per-car basis)
Follow the instructions inside the car folder's "!README AND INSTRUCTIONS.txt".
