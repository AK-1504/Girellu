# Arch Modified Physics License
>**Attention drifters! Do not use CSP versions from 1.78 to 1.73**. Otherwise tires will have an unknown force pushing the car, which makes drifting more difficult.

As of 31 December 2022,

**You are allowed to:**
* Use Arch modified physics on personal work
* Archive or back up Arch modified physics for personal use

**You are NOT allowed to, without express consent:**
* Credit Arch if Arch modified physics is changed
* Commercially use Arch modified physics
* Reupload Arch modified physics on other websites, i.e. RaceDepartment or AssettoLand

**Additional Notes**
* Support is not promised; if there is a technical issue, it is user error.
* No guarantee for satisfactory user experience unless using appropriate professional simulation peripherals with [correct configuration](https://github.com/archibaldmilton/Girellu/wiki/AC-Startup-Guide#force-feedback-ffb). 
	- For example, your G29 @ 30FPS can not keep up with the rotation speed of these cars.
