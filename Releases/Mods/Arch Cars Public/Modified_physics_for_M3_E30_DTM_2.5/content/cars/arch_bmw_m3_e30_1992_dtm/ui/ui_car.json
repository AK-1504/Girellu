  "description": "Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft 1992. Schnitzer engine specification.<br><br>Genuine racing car build at Group A specification using homologated parts.<br>Major changes include raising front subframe 20mm and rear subframe 12mm. Extensive work using offset parts has been done to retain camber curves and achieve near-zero bumpsteer in the front.<br><br>The rear&#39;s sweep angle has been changed from 15deg to 12deg, resulting in a milder camber and toe curve under movement. The higher trailing arm angle in the rear retains more anti-squat and moves the position of the camber and toe curve, allowing for a more ideal camber angle to be achieved at the greatly lowered height. <br><br>Steering is also faster due to installation of an unassisted circuit racing gearbox.<br><br>Alignment is adjustable via camber/caster top up front and adjustable trailing arm joints in the rear.<br>Main links of the suspension including trailing arm links have been replaced with solid alternatives.<br>Engine and transmission are built to DTM specification; higher power and 6-speed gearbox.<br><br>Setup tip: Tires require quite hard driving to built heat. Don&#39;t be afraid of some sliding. Characteristics of tires are different, mainly in compliance<br>and camber sensitivity. Approximate setups based on Group A manual specs:<br>Yokohama: Camber -4.0, -4.0 Toe -0.02, 0.09<br>Pirelli: Camber -2.2, -2.2 Toe -0.02, -0.05<br><br>Setup tip: If the course requires driving over very bumpy areas, for example kerbs or in a hillclimb, it might be advisable to lower the rollbar rates. ARBs couple the wheels together, which can cause oscillation of the wheels if the rates are too high for the course&#39;s surface.",
