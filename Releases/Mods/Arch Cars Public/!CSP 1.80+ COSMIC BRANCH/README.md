# Arch Modified Physics
> As the name implies, this is a branch for CSP versions 1.80 and beyond (as of now, 1.79 cosmic is broken). Read more about cosmic suspension [here](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Cars-%E2%80%93-Cosmic-Suspension).

## Installation
The install_arch_cars.bat script will automate installing of the car mods inside this folder. If you want to individually download cars, then you will have to manually install them.
### Automated .bat script install (recommended method, installs all cars)
Run the install_arch_cars.bat script and follow instructions within. Any errors mean you are missing a mod or AC DLC content.
### Manual install (individual, per-car basis)
Follow the instructions inside the car folder's "!README AND INSTRUCTIONS.txt".
