## Filter Notes
This filter was originally made by Kelnor; however, Kelnor has disappeared from the internet for some unknown reason. Kelnor's abandoned K34 filter is now revived by Phillip. The revived filter is meant to improve on Kelnor's well renowned glare, while maintaining practicality for driving. Due to the bloomy nature of K34, there is to be expected slight overexposure on bright surfaces.

**Settings:**

This filter recommends using Sol WFX's 2D clouds rendering method which is found on Page 7 in the Sol config under "Clouds Render Method" (set the slider to 0.)

Ask Philip#8036 for questions and concerns about K34 filter.
