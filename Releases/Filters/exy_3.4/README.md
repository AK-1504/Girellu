# Filter Notes
> Exy Filter will be updated again around 2022 for compatibility with current CSP and Sol visuals.

**Update 3.4:**

This filter pack contains 3 photography filters to emulate how promo shoots appear in post, and 4 heavily stylized artistic filters.

The neutral filters can be run for racing to provide a more finished post-processing look for AC, more akin to visually polished games like *Project Cars* or *Drive Club*. On the other hand, the photo filters may contain color gradings too heavy for regular use unless desired. Each filter is developed with its own look and feel, and is meant to do away with the common videogame-looking color blues and saturation appearances of default AC filters.

**CSP Presets (from Rusty):**

Exposure may be adjusted per shoot for best results.
