**Frequently Asked Questions:**

*"I use a triple screen/ultrawide monitor and left/right edge is completely black, what should I do?"*

Go to `assettocorsa\system\cfg\ppfilters\A3PP.ini`, open it and set Vignetting strength to 0. There will be an update of CSP to prevent this issue.

*"Your mod looks bad/doesn't work"*

Disable A3PP in Content - Mods and then re-enable it, then try again. If that does not work, head to discussion tab and I will help you ASAP.

*"What is A3PP Config app?"*

It's an addon that can modify my filter settings. It's not required to be enabled because the filter is ready as it is.
