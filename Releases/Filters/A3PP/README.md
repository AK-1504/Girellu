**Frequently Asked Questions:**

*I use a triple screen/ultrawide monitor and left/right edge is completely black. What should I do?*

Go to assettocorsa\system\cfg\ppfilters\A3PP.ini, open it and set Vignetting strength to 0.
There will be an update of CSP to prevent this issue.

*Your mod doesn't work/looks bad*

Head to discussion tab and I will help you ASAP. Before that, disable A3PP and then re-enable it in Content - Mods, then try again

*What is A3PP Config app?*

It's an addon that can modify my filter settings. It's not required to be enabled because it's ready as it is
