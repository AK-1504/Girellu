## Filter Notes
> Photorealistic:

Compatible with Pure and Sol, natural look and adjustable to your linking. It's the recommended as it is a neutral base where you can adjust it to your liking. The first two pictures above were made using this filter on Pure.
 
> Photorealistic_PHOTO:

Compatible with Sol, if you are a Pure user, use Photorealistic instead. The last two pictures above were made using this filter on Sol.

## Customization
If you are a Pure user, you can modify many parameters of the filter in the PP tab inside Pure Config app in realtime. Allowing you to switch from a natural look to a vibrant contrasty look. Have a look at this example where in the first image filmic contrast is set to 100, gamma to 1.0 and the exposure target is boosted. Compared to the second one where default values were used.
